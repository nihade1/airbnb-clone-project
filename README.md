# Airbnb Clone Project

## About the Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a real-world full-stack application simulating the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. This project dives deep into backend architecture, database design, API development, and application security. It provides a hands-on opportunity to understand complex systems, workflows, and teamwork dynamics while building a scalable web platform.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design.
- Implement advanced security practices for APIs.
- Gain experience with CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment.
- Improve documentation and software planning skills.
- Integrate Django, MySQL, and GraphQL into a cohesive system.

---

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for developing server-side logic, creating RESTful or GraphQL APIs, and integrating frontend requests with backend services.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, manages, and optimizes the relational database schema, ensuring data integrity, relationships, and performance.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent and automated delivery of the application.

### Security Specialist
Focuses on securing APIs, databases, and user authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance.

### Project Manager
Oversees project timelines, coordinates team communication, and ensures deliverables are completed according to plan.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: Web framework used to build the backend and REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used to manage structured data such as users, bookings, and listings.
- **GraphQL**: A flexible query language used for efficient client-server communication.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows (CI/CD).
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy for serving the application in production environments.

## Database Design

### Entities and Key Fields

- **Users**
  - id
  - username
  - email
  - password
  - role (guest/host)

- **Properties**
  - id
  - title
  - description
  - location
  - user_id (FK to Users)

- **Bookings**
  - id
  - user_id (FK to Users)
  - property_id (FK to Properties)
  - start_date
  - end_date

- **Reviews**
  - id
  - user_id (FK to Users)
  - property_id (FK to Properties)
  - rating
  - comment

- **Payments**
  - id
  - booking_id (FK to Bookings)
  - amount
  - status
  - payment_date

### Relationships

- A **user** can own multiple **properties**.
- A **booking** is linked to one **user** and one **property**.
- A **review** is written by a **user** for a **property**.
- A **payment** is associated with one **booking**.

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**
  - Users can register, log in, update profiles, and manage authentication credentials.

- **Property Management**
  - Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with images and descriptions.

- **Booking System**
  - Guests can book available properties and receive confirmation after payment.

- **Review System**
  - Guests can leave reviews and rate properties after a stay.

- **Payment Integration**
  - Bookings are completed with secure payment processing and transaction tracking.

- **Search & Filter**
  - Users can search properties by location, date, price, and other filters.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication**
  - JWT or OAuth2 mechanisms will be used to ensure only verified users can access protected resources.

- **Authorization**
  - Role-based access control to restrict users from performing unauthorized actions.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API requests a user can make within a time frame.

- **Data Validation and Sanitization**
  - Prevents injection attacks and ensures only valid data is processed.

**Why Security Matters:**

- Protects user credentials and personal information.
- Secures payment transactions.
- Prevents unauthorized data access and misuse.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying updates to production environments.

### Tools to be Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Docker**: Standardizes development and production environments.
- **Nginx + Gunicorn**: Serves the application in a scalable way.

CI/CD ensures fast, reliable, and error-free delivery of new features while reducing manual intervention.
